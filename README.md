# Predicting Smoking Status from Images: Deep Learning Model
Welcome to my Deep Learning project! This project focuses on building and training a computer vision / Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to predict people's smoking behavior.

Motivated by the urgent need to address public health issues, particularly related to public smoking behavior, I sought to leverage technology to develop a Deep Learning project that utilizes computer vision or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict a person's smoking behavior based on images. This project is expected to increase the effectiveness of detecting smoking behavior in public spaces.

## Introduction
In this project, I developed a CNN model to predict a person's smoking behavior based on images. The model was built using TensorFlow, a popular neural network library/framework, through which I leveraged its capabilities to train and optimize the model. The goal of this project is to assist public inspectors in automatically identifying a person's smoking behavior based on the images provided/captured.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/smoking). In general, this dataset consists of images depicting people both smoking and not smoking, with the image data for training, validation, and testing grouped into separate folders.

## Installation
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository: `git clone git@github.com:teguhsukmanaa/Smoking-Detection-Computer-Vision.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Or download the files manually.

## Usage
To use the trained model for detecting the smoking behavior image, follow these steps:
1. Load the pre-trained model weights
2. Preprocess the input data
3. Make predictions using the model

## Results
The CNN model achieved a prediction accuracy of 70%, with its performance classified as 'Goodfit'. In other words, this model can distinguish images of people exhibiting non-smoking behavior with 70% accuracy.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's collaborate and make this project even better!

## Deployment
I have deployed my model in Huggingface platform for prototype utilization. Try to check your image!. Check out at this link : https://huggingface.co/spaces/teguhsukmanaa/FTDS-RMT-029-GC7-Computer-Vision
